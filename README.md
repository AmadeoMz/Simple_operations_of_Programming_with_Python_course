# Simple_statistical_Operations_with_csv-files
This is a small tool that I learned to make in the "Programming with Python" course from Software Carpentry (https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/).

Calculate the Mean (--mean), Maximum (--max), and Minimum (-- min) value of your .csv file.
